## Lack of Understanding

If at any time you feel like you don't know at what direction all of this is going, take a look at these answers to some of the most important questions:

1) ***What do I want to accomplish via making this application?***
	What's really important to understand about one's journey to greatness is not how good his idea of accomplishing it is, but rather how much he persists to achieve it. Making an application for writing articles in a student based community isn't anything unique, I bet there are hundreds of web sites or applications, generally speaking, which do the exact same thing my application will be doing. Nevertheless I believe in the journey and not in the final result as the reason for achieving great things.

2) ***Who should this application be for?***
	This app is targeted to students of all sorts. Whether it's a primary school, high school or any other type of school, this application is going to be reliable, easily usable and it will provide the user with the necessary things for sharing knowledge. 

3) ***What should this application provide the user with?***
	The user should be presented with a minimalist choice of options so that he doesn't become confused at any time during sharing his knowledge. If one has to explain something to others or just generally present an interesting topic, he's probably already done enough work and only wants to share his thoughts. He's possibly already tired, so we shouldn't provide him with any complexity at all. The leading motive of this creation should be =="accessibility, minimalism & intuitiveness"==.

4) ***What problem should this application solve?***
	There have been countless incidents of me having trouble to start learning certain topics or generally feeling stupid for not being able to get something quickly through my *thick skull*. I'd like this application to solve these issues that, again, had persisted throughout my life so many times I can't even count. It's really important for me to create a platform on which teenagers (mostly) can exchange their thoughts or interests without feeling any pressure from the society or anyone else. I'd like to believe that one day these issues will be addressed more properly than by some random guy on the internet (that's me) but we'll see.

5) *Why not any other idea but rather this specific one?*
