## Lack of Understanding

If at any time you feel like you don't know at what direction all of this is going, take a look at these answers to some of the most important questions:

1. **_What do I want to accomplish via making this application?_**  
   What's really important to understand about one's journey to greatness is not how good his idea of accomplishing it is, but rather how much he persists to achieve it. Making an application for writing articles in a student based community isn't anything unique, I bet there are hundreds of web sites or applications, generally speaking, which do the exact same thing my application will be doing. Nevertheless I believe in the journey and not in the final result as the reason for achieving great things.

2. **_Who should this application be for?_**  
   This app is targeted to students of all sorts. Whether it's a primary school, high school or any other type of school, this application is going to be reliable, easily usable and it will provide the user with the necessary things for sharing knowledge.

3. **_What should this application provide the user with?_**  
   The user should be presented with a minimalist choice of options so that he doesn't become confused at any time during sharing his knowledge. If one has to explain something to others or just generally present an interesting topic, he's probably already done enough work and only wants to share his thoughts. He's possibly already tired, so we shouldn't provide him with any complexity at all. The leading motive of this creation should be _"accessibility, minimalism & intuitiveness"_.

4. **_What problem should this application solve?_**  
   There have been countless incidents of me having trouble to start learning certain topics or generally feeling stupid for not being able to get something quickly through my _thick skull_. I'd like this application to solve these issues that, again, had persisted throughout my life so many times I can't even count. It's really important for me to create a platform on which teenagers (mostly) can exchange their thoughts or interests without feeling any pressure from the society or anyone else. I'd like to believe that one day these issues will be addressed more properly than by some random guy on the internet (that's me) but we'll see.

5. **_Why not any other idea but rather this specific one?_**  
   It's better to gather knowledge as a group and share with one another than to do everyting alone. If at any point you feel like only you have the rights to some piece of interesting information about the world, then you're mistaken. There is nothing worse than drastically trying to outsmart everyone around you while being frozen and standing in the same place for days, months or even years. One should think of knowledge as of some good that should be traded between people and the currency for this particular kind of transaction should be experience, expertise and motivation as there's nothing better than the feeling of "Oh, I get it now, wasn't so hard to understand after all, was it?".
