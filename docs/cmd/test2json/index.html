		<p>Test2json converts go test output to a machine-readable JSON stream.
<p>Usage:
<pre>go tool test2json [-p pkg] [-t] [./pkg.test -test.v=test2json]
</pre>
<p>Test2json runs the given test command and converts its output to JSON;
with no command specified, test2json expects test output on standard input.
It writes a corresponding stream of JSON events to standard output.
There is no unnecessary input or output buffering, so that
the JSON stream can be read for “live updates” of test status.
<p>The -p flag sets the package reported in each test event.
<p>The -t flag requests that time stamps be added to each test event.
<p>The test should be invoked with -test.v=test2json. Using only -test.v
(or -test.v=true) is permissible but produces lower fidelity results.
<p>Note that &quot;go test -json&quot; takes care of invoking test2json correctly,
so &quot;go tool test2json&quot; is only needed when a test binary is being run
separately from &quot;go test&quot;. Use &quot;go test -json&quot; whenever possible.
<p>Note also that test2json is only intended for converting a single test
binary&apos;s output. To convert the output of a &quot;go test&quot; command that
runs multiple packages, again use &quot;go test -json&quot;.
<h3 id="hdr-Output_Format">Output Format</h3>
<p>The JSON stream is a newline-separated sequence of TestEvent objects
corresponding to the Go struct:
<pre>type TestEvent struct {
	Time    time.Time // encodes as an RFC3339-format string
	Action  string
	Package string
	Test    string
	Elapsed float64 // seconds
	Output  string
}
</pre>
<p>The Time field holds the time the event happened.
It is conventionally omitted for cached test results.
<p>The Action field is one of a fixed set of action descriptions:
<pre>start  - the test binary is about to be executed
run    - the test has started running
pause  - the test has been paused
cont   - the test has continued running
pass   - the test passed
bench  - the benchmark printed log output but did not fail
fail   - the test or benchmark failed
output - the test printed output
skip   - the test was skipped or the package contained no tests
</pre>
<p>Every JSON stream begins with a &quot;start&quot; event.
<p>The Package field, if present, specifies the package being tested.
When the go command runs parallel tests in -json mode, events from
different tests are interlaced; the Package field allows readers to
separate them.
<p>The Test field, if present, specifies the test, example, or benchmark
function that caused the event. Events for the overall package test
do not set Test.
<p>The Elapsed field is set for &quot;pass&quot; and &quot;fail&quot; events. It gives the time
elapsed for the specific test or the overall package test that passed or failed.
<p>The Output field is set for Action == &quot;output&quot; and is a portion of the test&apos;s output
(standard output and standard error merged together). The output is
unmodified except that invalid UTF-8 output from a test is coerced
into valid UTF-8 by use of replacement characters. With that one exception,
the concatenation of the Output fields of all output events is the exact
output of the test execution.
<p>When a benchmark runs, it typically produces a single line of output
giving timing results. That line is reported in an event with Action == &quot;output&quot;
and no Test field. If a benchmark logs output or reports a failure
(for example, by using b.Log or b.Error), that extra output is reported
as a sequence of events with Test set to the benchmark name, terminated
by a final event with Action == &quot;bench&quot; or &quot;fail&quot;.
Benchmarks have no events with Action == &quot;pause&quot;.
